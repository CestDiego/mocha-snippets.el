# Mocha YASsnippets

I like [Mocha][1], and I use it a lot. As such, I have a bunch of
snippets that I've developed for it to make working with tests faster.

## Note

This is also a project for me to get my feet wet with writing and
publishing elisp packages. I figured it I'd start out with something
that just delivers something other than editor functionality.... a
parcel of snippets.
